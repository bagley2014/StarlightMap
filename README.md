# StarlightMap

StarlightMap is a webpage which provides an interactive map of the Isle of Starlight forum game by LoneStarNorth, accessible at http://willsaveworldforgold.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=11 .

A big thanks to him and to the community for what they are doing on this forum.

## Dependencies
This software depends on
 - MongoDB
 - Nightmare JS
 - xfvb (optional, for server deployment)

If you want to run it, please verify that your server has these installed. Node.js dependencies can be installed by running:
```
npm install
```

## Testing
To set up StarlightMap, ensure that MongoDB is running on default settings (accessible at localhost:27017). If xfvb is available, StarlightMap can be started by running:
```
npm start
```

Alternatively, it is possible to test StarlightMap on a local machine without xfvb by running:
```
node_modules/.bin/webpack && node index.js
```

Either way, the server will listen on port 3000, and thus the page can be viewed at localhost:3000. In order to retrieve or update data (including the map image), send a POST request to localhost:3000/refresh; this can be accomplished via:
```
curl -X POST localhost:3000/refresh
```

If you want to use a different port than the default one, you can set the environment variable `STARLIGHT_PORT`
